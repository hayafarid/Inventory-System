// Super store inventory system:
My program is structured to manage an inventory system, allowing for user interaction to manipulate the inventory, simulate sales transactions, and generate basic reports.
The programming language is c++ and I have incorporated most of the concepts I have learnt from my cs100 course at my university. The program makes use of libraries, functions,loops,arrays,pointers and many other concepts to effieciently run a superstore inventory system. 
There are 4 user defined functions declared in the program which correspond to the 4 tasks carried out by the system.
